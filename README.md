# Word Guess

## Description

This project is a simple game that allows the user to guess the word by supplying keyboard input. It keeps track of the player's wins and losses by recording them to local storage.

## Usage

The player starts the game by clicking 'Start'. With each keyboard input, correct letters will populate on screen and the word will become clearer. Once the word has been correctly guessed, or the timer expires, the user is presented with the result of their game and their record is updated. The record is persisted in local storage between sessions and can be cleared using the 'Reset Score' button.
